There's a lot going on here, so where do you even start with this thing?


### Basic Navigation

When Kali starts up you will be on the MAIN PAGE, generally on any other page you can **click** the **left encoder** to return to it.

If you are on the MAIN screen and you **click** the **left encoder**, you will enter the LFO EDIT screen.

On the MAIN PAGE, there are several sub-pages you can cycle between by **rotating** the **left encoder**.

On the MAIN PAGE, **rotating** the **right encoder** will change the DELAY MODE

On the LFO EDIT screen, you can choose the TARGET LFO you wish to edit (1L,2L,3L and 1R,2R,3R) by **rotating** the **left encoder**.

On the MAIN screen's sub-pages, and on the LFO EDIT screen, **clicking** the **right encoder** will change the PARAM you'd like to edit. **Rotating** the **right encoder** will change this PARAM's value.

When you are done editing, **click** the **left encoder** to return to the MAIN screen.

Note: On the MAIN screen, clicking the right encoder will re-sync the LFOs and clock outputs, which is useful if you have changed timing settings. This resets the phase of all of the waveforms (i.e. it returns the shape to the point where it begins).

Again, if you find yourself lost, **click** the **left encoder** to return to the MAIN PAGE. Unless you are on the MAIN PAGE, because then you'll switch to the LFO EDIT page.

### Places to Start

Being that this is a Eurorack module, there is no one correct way to use it, and we encourage exploring on your own, but here are some tips.

#### Experiment with the FX modes.

The right encoder changes "major" mode, there are currently 4: "Basic", "Parvati", "Kali", and "External Feedback". Each of these has several submodes that you can switch between with the 'delay adj' knob to the left. Each submode has 2 settings that map to the "Meta 1" and "Meta 2" knobs.

Start with the following settings:
* META 1 and META 2 0%.
* L TIME and R TIME 25%.
* CUTOFF 75-100%.
* FEEDBACK 50-80% or so (this can run wild in some modes).
* WET/DRY 50%.
* DELAY ADJ 0%

Now with some audio input, start adjusting the Meta 1 and Meta 2 knobs.

#### Experiment with the LFO modes.

On the MAIN PAGE, **click** the **left encoder** to enter the LFO EDIT page.

This page is laid out like so -

    `
    | LFO MODE  |         | MULTIPLIER/DIVIDER       |
    |           |         |                          |
    | SHAPE     | LFO ADJ | POLARITY/POLARITY+INVERT |`
