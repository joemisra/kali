*First note, if you do not like the beta and wish to revert to the last 1.0 version, this is possible, follow the usual upload instructions, on first powerup w/ eurorack power hold down the SYNC and FREEZE buttons and it should reset your saved settings to the older format.*

*Claude & Kali note: I know many creative people have valid concerns about AI assisted work, so disclaimer here - I have used Claude 3.5-3.7 for refactoring legacy code, general housekeepeing, some DSP math, writing documentation, and for learning ways to improve or add new features.*

 *If your concerns outweigh the positive/educational/greedless use of LLMs, it's fine, simply don't use the 2.0 firmware.*

# Kali 2.0 Beta

**[Update Procedure](UPDATE.md)**

I have not finished all of the features I had wanted to add to this version, and some of the granular functions are still not re-implemented, but so much significant change is working I figured time to throw this out here while I finish up!

You can flip through the CHANGELOG.md I will be working on a manual for this. This time w/ help from Claude so it will be easier to explore how things work now.
