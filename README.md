dsp.coffee kali 1.x firmware!

to install 

**keep eurorack power off while using usb** 

* Download most recent Kali firmware from this repository.

* In a Chrome browser window, navigate to the [Electrosmith Web Programmer](https://electro-smith.github.io/Programmer/)

* Once there, connect the Daisy Patch Submodule on the back of Kali to your computer using a micro USB cable. 

* Put the Daisy into flashable mode by holding down the BOOT button, and pressing the RESET button. Once you release the RESET button you can let go of the BOOT button (You'll know you performed the button combo correctly if the USER LED on your Daisy stops flashing)

* Connect Daisy as a DFU device by clicking the "Connect" button at the top of the Web Programmer page

* In the dialog box that opens, select "DFU in FS Mode" and then click "Connect"

* Unzip the kali________.zip you downloaded, near the bottom of the programmer page will be an option to select a file from your computer, choose Kali.bin from the unzipped archive.
