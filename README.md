dsp.coffee kali 1.x firmware!

to install

**keep eurorack power off while using usb** 

* don't plug into your computer yet, plug micro-usb cable into daisy patch submodule, now hold boot button while plugging it into your computer (you can also do this when already plugged in by holding the boot button and then pressing the reset button)

* use the electrosmith daisy web programmer https://electro-smith.github.io/Programmer/ to flash the new firmware. if it was successful, kali will reboot and the screen will turn back on. you should see some activity there, but lfo outputs will not be active until it's back on eurorack power.

* unplug it from usb before trying eurorack power.
